# covid19tracker

Infodemics ([infodemics.com](https://infodemics.com)) uses existing social hierarchies in a community to efficiently and effectively communicate health risk.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has a [simple message](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1239581568101945348) for all countries: Test, test, test every suspected COVID19 case*

Infodemics, as a risk communication platform hopes that [this tracker](https://infodemics.com/covid19tracker) would help with this effort.
